The product can be installed on the Raspberry Pi. Then run:
sudo /etc/init.d/pi-web-agent start
to start the apache2 instance that serves the application.
Access the appliation via:
https://raspberrypi:8003
Default username and password is admin. If raspberrypi does not work on the browser address bar use
the full ip as your internet router may not match the hostnames.
